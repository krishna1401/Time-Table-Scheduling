# Time Table Scheduling
> This Time Table Scheduling Problem defines a task to creating a Schedule for a Department of Computer Science, University of Delhi for all the 5 batches in the department for each academic semester.

## Inputs
1. List of Subjects
2. List of Teachers
3. List of Rooms
4. Batch Detials

## Output
Defined Time Table

## Approach
There are two possible Approach for the same problem:
1. **[Constraint Satisfaction Problem](https://github.com/krishna1401/Time-Table-Scheduling/tree/master/Constraint%20Satisfaction%20Algorithm)**: It is a process of finding a solution to a set of constraints imposed on the solution set that must be satisfied for a given problem.
2. **Genetic Algorithm**: It is based on the concept of *Darwin's theory of Evolution*, considering a random possible solutions and then continously evolving towards the tru solution by *crossover & mutation* of solutions.

## How to Use?
1. Open Constraint Satisfaction Problem project in any Java IDE
2. Execute the Main.java class
3. Output files will be created in *Time Table* folder within the project folder
